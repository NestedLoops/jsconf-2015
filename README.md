# JavaScript, what are you?

An audio-visual performance written in Web Audio and Web MIDI by Boris Lechelt ([@bonotes](https://twitter.com/bonotes)), Kahlil Lechelt ([@kahliltweets](https://twitter.com/kahliltweets)) and Jan Monschke ([@thedeftone](https://twitter.com/thedeftone)) for [JSConf.eu 2015](http://2015.jsconf.eu/).

## How to play

Go to http://nestedloops.github.io/jsconf-2015/, plug in your Launchpad and jam :)

Also have a look at the code or only `mappings.js` to see which key maps to which functionality.

## How to navigate the code

_Disclaimer: As most of our side projects, this project suffered from last-minute code hacks, we apologize sincerely ;)_

Start in `index.js` which loads all video clips and then initializes the MIDI device. The MIDI device is accessed in `controller.js` and only supports Launchpad devices for now. Each clip is mapped to a specific key in `mappings.js`. Check that file to learn which key is triggering which video clip. Make sure to check out `videonode.js` to see how to load and play video files with zero latency. You will notice that there are some other clips in the mapping as well. Some can be used to influence the visualisation, some are used to stop playback and some influence the intro / outro.
